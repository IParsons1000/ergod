INSTALLATION
------------

You can install with the installation script in this directory,
install.sh or by hand.

PLEASE NOTE: Installation by both methods requires gcc.

INSTALLATION WITH THE SCRIPT:

To install ergod with the provided installation script, execute:

	sudo ./install.sh

INSTALLATION BY HAND:

To install by hand, first build the daemon with:

	make

then, copy the binary to the appropraite directory, with:

	sudo mv ergod /usr/local/sbin

This following step is optional if you do not have SELinux
installed/enabled (test with the selinuxenabled command), and changes
the file context to make it accessable by systemd:
	
	sudo semanage fcontext -d -t bin_t -s system_u '/usr/local/sbin/ergod'
	sudo semanage fcontext -a -t bin_t -s system_u '/usr/local/sbin/ergod'
	sudo restorecon /usr/loca/sbin/ergod

next, copy the systemd unit file to the appropriate directory for
systemd, and make a symbolic link in another appropriate location with:

	sudo cp ergod.service /usr/lib/systemd/system
	sudo ln -s /usr/lib/systemd/system/ergod.service etc/systemd/system/ergod.service

and finally enable it and reload the daemons with:
	
	sudo systemctl enable ergod.service sudo systemctl daemon-reload
