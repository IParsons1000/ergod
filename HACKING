HACKING
-------

Anyone can hack ergod, as long as they follow the guidelines of the BSD
3-Clause License (see the `LICENSE' file in this directory), e.g.,
distributing the modified version of ergod with the same license.

To have your patch considered for inclusion, please send a diff output
to the ergod maintainer, or submit a pull request on GitHub (be warned--
the GitHub repo is a clone of a locally-hosted repo and I do not check it
as regularly as my email).

A SHORT DESCRIPTION OF ergod'S INTERNALS

ergod is a systemd service, meaning that it is run in the background by
systemd at startup.

ergod consists of an infinite loop that waits an interval (default twenty
minutes), and then forks (actually vfork's for effeciency), execv's the
specified (default `wall') command, and then exits back into the main
program.

ergod uses journal for logging by default, but can use syslog if
compiled with -DUSE_SYSLOG. NOTE: ergod's journal logs can be viewed
with:
	journalctl --unit=ergod
